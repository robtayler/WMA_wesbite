				<p>What is a kata?</p>
				</header>
				<p>
				Kata (形, or more traditionally, 型) (literally: "form") is a Japanese word describing detailed patterns 
				of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. Each is a complete fighting system, with the movements 
				and postures of the kata being a living reference guide to the correct form and structure of the techniques 
				used within that system. Karate Kata are executed as a specified series of a variety of moves, 
				with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. The practitioner is counseled 
				to visualise the enemy attacks and their responses. Karateka "read" a kata in order to explain the 
				imagined events. The kata is not intended as a literal depiction of a mock fight, but as a display 
				of transition and flow from one posture and movement to another, teaching the student proper form 
				and position, and encouraging them to visualise different scenarios for the use of each motion and 
				technique. There are various forms of kata, each with many minor variations.

				<p>front arm block or rear arm block?</p>
				<p>Posted 45 minutes ago</p>
				<p>There has been some debate about the use of rear arm blocking and what is the most effective way to defend from a punch. Should the front arm always be used because it is quicker?.</p>

				<h3>How to improve your side kick in 3 easy steps</h3>
				<p>Posted 45 minutes ago</p>
			</header>
			<p>The side kick is a powerful kick if used correctly, but if not it can lack power and flick like a poorly formatted roundhouse.
			Step one: have a good chamber position.
			Step two: turn the base foot to point 180 degree from the direction of the attacker, and to rotate the hips for full extension.
			Step three. foot forming, point toes up to extend the heel and direct the power towards your target.</p>
